      "Transcription: what [Applause] [Music] this is the fourth generation of the Maru Suzuki desire this car is priced between 8 to 12.1 lakh rupees on Mumbai so yes the prices have gone up dramatically however we have got a festar rated marui Suzuki car before GTA 6 yes this gu has got top rating from Global encap in terms of crash test rating which is amazing CU finally we have a Muk car which is safe as well which means bye-bye DK Fanboys because this car is going to set the sales chart on fire in terms of competition it obviously competes with the Honda amaz the Tata tigor and also the Hyundai Aura and that's the reason the perfume for today is the aura from invol your senses this is the involve elements Aura it's a nice black icy perfume it's a blended fragrance it smells awesome and it really refreshes your mood because once you spray it inside the cabin it really lifts the Ambiance of the cabin dramatically so go check out the aura I'm talking about the car perfume not the car yet anyways straight away let me show you the key of the car because we've got a new key as well what's new this is the same as before but now we have a button to unlock the boot of the vehicle unlock the car lock the car and that's about it not much has changed to be honest straight away let's open the engine bay because this is at the end of the day a Swift with the boot not really you can see that the engine is vibrating a bit because one cylinder down now power is gone down and yeah Tor is also gone down here so that's a bit disappointing because maluki is like fuel efficiency for the wind there is insulation there of course washer fluid goes in right there but there's so much space in the engine because this car was made for four cylinders not for three the design has been revised quite a lot so no longer it looks like a swift witha the boot because the front end is super different when compared to before which is amazing because now this car has an identity of its own coming to the lights of the car they will actually remind you of Audi lights yeah these are full LED lights okay this is hallogen this is the LED DRL these two elements are actually for the high beam rest are obviously for the low beam you obviously get LED fog lamps as well but you also get a front parking camera the Suzuki logo piano black finishing there a chrome there a strip running right there which is kind of cool and a hexagonal sort of a grill yeah I mean the grill is actually quite big with six slots as well the design looks awesome the design looks amazing now yeah it never looked amazing to me before but now it definitely looks awesome in terms of Dimensions it is the same as before however it is taller by 10 mm so in terms of length it is 3995 mm which is basically the length is under 4 M but in terms of wheelbase it's the same as a swift 2450 mm the ground clearance is 163 mm so this actually looks better now the way the the roof has been done so it doesn't look like someone has slapped on a boot to the Swift much better design good job maluki Suzuki in terms of tire size 18560 515 is the size of the tires diamond cut alloy vs the mid variant has different design I think for the alloy vs you get a camera here what are you talking a sub meter car getting cameras everywhere which is amazing and you get a request sensor here which hyai does not offer so Marti lets you enter from either of the side without having to remove the key which is again awesome space at the rear is actually good compared to the Swift well the inter gets the beige treatment for the seats and slight color differences and more features otherwise it's the identical interior to the Swift so I'm not complaining because the Swift interior is actually quite good space at the rear is actually quite nice under thigh support is obviously not the best and head room seems to be adequate for someone as tall as me yeah my cap is almost touching but then for a car of this size it's actually quite nice you get a center armrest which I'll open from here yeah it has a center arm rest with twin cup holders as well it gets isopix child seat mounts three proper seat belts Center passenger no no no no no no no no headit for the center passenger you get a handle to hold on to light placement here on the top why on the top why not in the center because it gets a sunroof first in segment sunroof awesome rear AC winds and you get two charging sockets one is a USBC and the other is a usba this is scooped out there's a magazine holder here no height adjustable seat Bel six airbags as well it's actually very impressive and the dashboard is very similar to the Swift however color changes have been done to distinguish this car from the other cars in the segment rather specifically the Swift actually which is not in the segment actually what am I even talking door pockets are small here again beit treatment and all that obviously lot of hard plastics and doesn't seem like theyve added any weight to the doors although the doors are new the fenders are new and they have changed the contouring to make sure that production cost also go down because at the end of the day this is a budget car fuel goes in right here but now it's also available with CG right from launch at the rear things are a little similar when compared to before because the lights look kind of similar to the older model the boot as well as the bumper are also similar slight differences here and there you get this connected Chrome line here this is hallogen even the reverse light is hogen this is LED and have this gloss black finishing a subtle spoiler as well Shar fin antenna High mounted stop lamp Center passenger's head is missing and you obviously get a camera here you get four parking sensors at the rear awesome meanwhile the exhaust is hidden right below and it vibrates a bit because this car is now having three cylinders straight away let's open the boot I think the boot is around 382 L and it's very messy right now but the boot carrying capacity is increased by 4 L so not much minor increase and you obviously have these metal plates for better crash worthiness but why is there so much exposed stuff here how difficult was it to cover it in fact lot of exposed wiring here they should have covered it yeah why have they not covered it cost cutting off another level altogether spare wheel is not an alloy 165 8014 another way to cut cost obviously and the boot actually opens if you have the key in your pocket and if you're near the car yeah that obviously is how it works but in case you are not having the key in your pocket the boot will not open even if the car is unlocked so I think that's a safety feature of sort obviously the indicator has been given on the outside the door pockets are decent size at the front only one bottle can fit in right here elimination only for the driver side which is a one touch as well as a one touch I mean both one touch up and down but these switch gears are actually very dated now they come from this Swift back from 2005 so they need to change this for sure unlock the car lock the car CH lock and obviously to adjust the outside rear view mirrors yeah electric and uh you have Chrome handle here which is good they've used beige they've actually used a lot of colors in this car to differentiate it from the Swift beige color seats are nice actually the seats are quite comfortable says airbag here and you get a proper dead pedal as well this is to open the hood of the vehicle this is to open the fuel lid and this is to open the boot from the inside meanwhile this is for stop start system this is for the headlight leveler this is for traction control this is for the 360° parking camera and this is the engine start button all right everything is so similar to the Swift nothing has changed however you actually get a sunroof which is a single pane sunroof it's not very big but then at least we have a sunroof now it opens in two steps obviously let me just close it do I have to keep it pressed no I don't have to and it has I think some tinting on it which is a good thing so yeah this is a first in the segment thing here you get a mirror here you do not get a mirror you just get a strap here where it tells you take holder otherwise you would have put your laptop but a car which has a sunroof does not get an auto dimming mirror is quite baffling light controls here on the top but we need an auto dimming mirror obviously let's shut the door not much of a thir as such this is a 9in screen which is very complicated to pronounce because this is the Smart play Pro Plus why is it such a long name let me actually turn off the lights so that this becomes bright car has no fuel right now let me remove this sticker firstly and let me show you this awesome screen because firstly it's very easy to use I don't want to fill up fuel it's the same thing in almost every maruti it says 4.2 km per lit what happened to 24 km per lit claimed well the car is obviously being idling since some time but real world mileage is obviously not even close to what marui claims and that's something which is expected because AR does any sort of mileage so here let me get into this menu it tells you the driving there's nothing interesting as such is the usual bit but it does get something known as footwell lighting where did that go I was searching for it actually came in between and it vanished so yeah things could be a little EAS easier and more smoother but I think there's some sort of Light which actually comes out from here the glove box is also decent size but there's no cooling function here and it's a bit flimsy which has been the case with most of the maruti cars you've got multiple colors here so Swift has an all black cabin and the Swift get some silver finishing here and there this has black beige black this silver aluminium sort of finish this unpolished wood finish obviously this is fake wood and that's how it has been done here let's remove this plastic as well steering feels nice nice to hold it gets the flat bottom treatment it has this sort of a silver color as well these are the controls for the audio system this again is for phone call and also for voice command and this is for the cruise control system there's a wireless charging pad here 12vt charging socket USB a charging socket so this thing obviously has Apple car plan Android auto connectivity both of which actually work wirelessly let me press the view button here to see this whole thing spin around where is the sunroof in this thing I can't see it so it's not very accurate to what obviously Maru Suzuki has in the real world world yeah that is a nice view sort of remind me if I'm playing NFS and let me try and see another view again this car will spin it's the same camera as other maruti car this is an HD camera it has a good view quality of the cameras is actually quite nice yeah that's about it let me quickly get into reverse to show you the reverse parking camera that is the 360° view from the top got multiple views here which is a nice thing side views as well and when I turn the steering wheel you have got adaptive guidelines too quite nice I like it and that obviously brings me to the fact that there is no front center armrest I don't know why they have done cross cutting do they expect me to hang my hand in the air and let me quickly put this tag right here because this SC perfume the involve your senses or rather the involved elements Aura is extremely easy to use firstly I can carry it in my pocket effortlessly and then all I need to do is just pray it twice like this did I say pray it twice one two and oh my God I can feel the aura in the desire maybe I I find it quite amazing as well and I cannot play funs with the tigor this steering wheel is adjustable only for height yeah that's about it that's the only adjustment that happens and the wipers work decently well too however you've got physical controls here for the air conditioning and the air conditioning actually works nicely it's a climate control air conditioning system which is a good thing you have got twin cup holders here you get a nice gever which is stubby to operate and you get a handbrake here obviously which is nice I it and that also brings me to the instrument cluster of this car because it's analog which is amazing I think that's a 4.2 km per lit is not giving me the hint that it is a 4.2 in screen but usually the size is 4.2 in for that Center multi-information display you get an analog tachometer which resed 5,000 RPM speedometer fuel meter no fuel here at all and the temperature meter in order to browse through this I just press this button so it gives me a lot of information but you know what they should have had a button on the steering wheel to operate this power and torque meters I know that's quite old because the Balo had it obviously long time back so that's not something which is new there's no heads up display here it should not have a heads up display because for the price m is actually offering us a lot automatic headlights awesome this guy's also got ESP Hill hole assist and a rear defogger in all the variants and if you notice they've actually scooped it out from here because the sunroof has to go inside right right somewhere the sunroof needs to hide this is obviously very flimsy I just hope under heavy braking this doesn't close automatically but a sunroof in a potential capab potential because obviously this is not going to come to the cab Market immediately there's a whole story behind it which we shall talk while driving so let's go [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right it is time to start driving which means I turn on the car and unless and until I click on the clutch it's not going to happen makes this welcome sound has a Suzuki logo popping up right there let's turn off the air conditioning Suzuki logo is stuck here come on I know it's a Suzuki car but you can't be stuck there let's quickly change this parameter let's put the power and torque graphic meters level is low please spill the tank immediately yes lady I know it has connected car stuff as well so it's obviously telling me fuel level is low power and T meters there keep spinning handbrake down and we will also turn off the traction control there it is turned off and hazard lights off and driving the motor and off we go oh yes that is what lightweight gets you no you don't have to navigate me to any place at all straight off the bat let me tell you the car does not feel enthusiastic enough okay don't look at this because there's a slope here so I'm not giving it the beans right now we're going to come to a flat patch of Road and then only we will test how the acceleration of this car is so this is the z2e engine it's a a three-cylinder unit and things are not that Rosy when compared to before because they have downsize they've reduced one cylinder they didn't need to do it but theyve still gone ahead and removed one cylinder from the Cary compared to the old K12 engine which was just amazing an engine which did not need any updates has been updated unfortunately what is the off of updated downed or downgraded whatever so one cylinder down but in spite of the fact that one cylinder has gone down it's not like power has increased usually that is the case with downsizing this justifies by saying that you know what we have increased the power and torque by using a Turbocharger or whatever or whatever electric assist and all which is usually the case but no here power is actually gone down by 8 horsepower torque is gone down by 1.3 new M because the older engine the K12 actually produced 90 horsepower and 1130 new M this car produces 82 horsepower and 11.7 Newt M why have they done that in the interest of fuel efficiency in the interest of emissions as well it has a Lambda sensor to manage all that but crucially though this car is having a higher compression ratio for better thermal efficiency and that's the one of the major reasons why the overall efficiency has improved here emissions have also gone down it FS Pepe problem is it's not smooth or silent because lower down at idle you can feel the vibrations the older K12 engine did not have any vibrations it was VIP free it was smooth and refined this is not there is always that vibration at the lower end of the Rev range and when you rev it past 3 4,000 RPM it becomes extremely vocal not in a good way the older engine definitely sounded better as well and it was faster by at least a second to go from 0 to 100 km per hour so performance has has been downgraded here in the interest of fuel efficiency which has gone up by 2 km per liter in fact this car is less efficient when compared to the Swift by around 0.1 km per liter why such a small difference purely because this car obviously weighs slightly more 20 30 kgs more not as much more as you would expect because the Swift has a rear defogger I mean this also has it a rear Viper washer which is not there in this car so some weight difference here and there but overall because of the boot this car obviously weighs slightly more the gearbox is new and it is slick the clutch is a hydraulic unit it is also very slick yeah it's light and the Driving Experience is fantastic because the engine has been tuned for drivability it feels drivable it feeds pepy it feeds Punchy but Power tapers off quickly from around 3,000 RPM so it doesn't have that grunt you would expect for enthusiastic driving but for 99% of people they won't really care because it's more efficient and it is definitely very much drivable as well in fact you need to short shift and get the job done it even DS 300 RPM lesser when compared to before because red line now comes in at around 6,000 RPM so I'm a bit disappointed with the lack of high driving nature for a Japanese engine but globally this engine also gets mild hybrid technology in India no they don't offer that in fact they just gave us the stop Char system I thought they would have removed that as well because a lot of stuff always gets removed in India we need a turbo in this car not in this car at least in the Swift we should get the turbocharge engine from the franx so yes it's a easy non nonsense car to drive in terms of fuel efficiency expect around 14 to 15 km per liter in the city stretching to almost 18 to 19 km per lit out on the highway they also have a CNG now right from get-go which has almost 70 horsepower or 100 new M of talk I'm not sure about the exact numbers because the numbers also a little bit weird but CNG will really sell but it's the fourth most efficient Mai CNG car because marui obviously has the celerio CNG the vagana CNG and obviously the alto K10 CNG as well because of which this gu is like the fourth most efficient CNG car from Marti Suzuki but still it's very smooth very refined and definitely very I mean yeah no nonsense car there's no washer fluid inside right now so that's the reason there was no water there I love driving this car because so nice in terms of the gas shift it's very nice in terms of the clutch action as well which makes the question do you need to get an AMT in the first place the AMT will obviously be easier to drive because you don't have to shift gear and they have really refined the AMT but still there is that lag between shifts in fact the AMT is around 3 seconds slower when compared to the manual which is a lot and steering effort is also very less but the steering feels better than the last generation model for sure but not as good as the earlier generation the first generation of the desire because that was like really hard and tough this one has become very light but it's still having better feedback than the last generation model and it self centers too which is such a good thing yeah the engine becomes very vocal horn is not that good in spite of the fact there are two horns in this car one on either side in the front which you can clearly see when you see the grill of this vehicle so performance nothing impressive ride quality is actually very good here it absorbs most of the stuff in its stride and the handling is also decent because steering has decent field body roll is well in contain I mean it's quite contained because obviously the car is quite light now and in spite of the lightweight it's got top safety remarks which is amazing so five star rating for adult occup production fourstar rating for child occupant production so that could be better but Five star rated ma Suzuki car will silence all the haters all the critics of Mai Suzuki because who would have expected this car to perform so well and how did it perform so well well obviously they were aiming to give it great safety ratings earlier they were like you know we will comply with all the emission rules and regulations as per the Indian government but then they realize everyone is focusing towards safety and Tata Motors is making hay while the sunshines by getting top ratings and selling their cars to mati suuki is like enough B onoga we will get a safe car and they've managed to do that which is surprising and well appreciated as well so I hope they also send the Swift because Swift is the same car as a desire for crash test and if the Swift gets five star rating there oh my goodness game over for a lot of cars in the segment yeah this is just starting off and I don't know where it's going to end but it's definitely going to end up better for Indian customer who now will have a fuel efficient car which is also safe proving the fact that lightweight does not necessarily mean that the car is unsafe and that's something which Mercedes-Benz proved long back when they had the David versus golad match a crash test between the Mercedes S-Class Flagship San and the chintu minu smart 42 both of them crashed and both of them performed exceptionally well in the crash test because in spite of being small not necessary that you are bad brakes are decent in spite of the fact that the tires are relatively small brakes are actually quite good here because of the lightweight lightweight really helps in a lot of things but we definitely need a sportier version of the desire if not the desire at least for the Swift you have to offer us a sportier version there you can see engine makes all the sound but doesn't really move forward so briskly same displacement as the older engine which is 1,197 CC in fact the gearing is also the same for the first three gear but for the next two gears which is fourth and fifth they have opted for taller gearing which means the RPM would be lower when you are cruising and thus better fuel efficiency so they have really thought about fuel efficiency way too much do consumers really care so much about fuel efficiency with the lack of diesel engine available with Mar Suzuki definitely become important for them to also focus on fuel efficiency of their cars and that's something they've been doing since donkey years because Mari Suzuki has always been about and this gu absolutely excels AR numbers will blow your mind 24.79% that well it's quite slow 3 second slow is like obnoxiously slow anyways I think this is a good patch of road to do the 0 to 100 kmh test and into first gear here we are no I think it's a bit of a slope so we'll get going come on pull pull pull look at it go all the way to the red line that a wagon AR is overtaking us right now it's very fun car to drive actually because it's a pocket rocket of salts I mean it's not very fast but at least it's efficient on your pocket and then it gets the job done so not many people are going to complain about the performance only enthusias like what is this but then most Enthusiast will end up opting for the Swift so with the Swift they'll complain more with the desire they'll complain less and Mau Suzuki knows that and that's the reason why they like you know it's okay downsizing is good because I think it will be cheaper for them to manufacture the car it will be cheaper for people to run the car it will be more efficient and it will obviously meet with emission Norms so so many positives but downsizing only a negative in terms of dropping the power if they had kept this three-cylinder Engine with more power people wouldn't have complained they like okay CH cylinder reduce care but at least we've got more power now but how did they go from 90 to 82 I don't understand only how did they go from 113 to 11.7 okay that's a minor difference so I'm not really going to complain much about that let's stop here let's launch it and let's time it right away okay let's go I'm happy to report that the traction control does not turn off automatically usually that is the case or rather turn on automatically with a lot of cars these days so it completely is off all the time Once you turn it off obviously now the older desire which is the third generation desire got only two star rating and Marti I think voluntarily sent both the generations of the car the fourth and the third generation but that was a very wrong move you know why because Mari is like let us prove how we have improved in safety from two to five stars but they forgot one thing they're going to still continue selling the third generation model in a place where safety is even more important because the third generation model is going to sold your on at has the Desir t s for the cab Market which means that I am relying on someone driving the car who is driving the car day and night who's going to be tired probably who might tend to drive a bit rashly at times because uh he wants to do more trips in a day the cab needs to be more safer because the cab is going to run a lot more on the roads and the cab is having two star rating so that's something which is a bit disappointing they really need to give this generation of the desire to cabbies as well but they're like you know let's sell the old stock let the cabbies Drive something which is dated come on the cabbies also deserve a five star rated car now let's come to the pricing of this car it starts at R 8 L for the base variant the LXI obviously which I don't think Mari even sells or gives to customers because uh sorry not to even dealers because the dealers will obviously pull you or push you to upgrade to the vxi at least so the trim levels are LXI vxi ZXI ZXI plus largely and then obviously there's petrol there's manual there's automatic all the gearboxes are 5-speed units which is honestly quite dated we need a six-speed gearbox as a so in terms of sales this car is selling 11 to 13,000 units a month which is a lot if you ask me but almost 40% of the sales are coming from the cab market so around 4 to 5,000 units a month from the tour s only which clearly shows that uh the price advantage of selling a older generation car is been passed on to the cabbies and uh major chunk of the sales are coming from the cab market and that's the reason when this car got five star rating everyone was commenting now my cab is safe no no no no your cab is still not say your cab is still having two star rating only so if you up for the automatic you pay a premium of 72,000 rup for the CNG you pay R 71,000 more and this is the top end petrol manual which is priced at 11.38 LH rupees so the top end uh automatic is going to 12.1 L rupees okay a slight bump little firmness is here or there but it's not much overall prices have increased by rupes 83,000 for the top end variants because now we have a sunroof obviously so it starts rupees 41,000 more when compared to before so the prices of the new Swift and the old desire are actually the exact [Music] same okay the car is turned off automatically now once I press the clutch it turns on let's turn off the stop start system let me turn on the 360° camera because why not and let's reset this for the launch which I'm going to do there's a slope ahead so I'm not sure how accurate it's going to be handbrake down air conditioning off driving the motor yeah thankfully drives and off we go slick and then obviously there's some wheel spin as well when you upshift that's 14 and 1 12 seconds to go from 0 to 100 km hour which is sluggish imagine how fast the CNG would be 69.5 horsepower and 10 1.8 new M of torque that's disappointing performance but people who buy C they like efficiency and then they are happy in their own Zone that said the efficiency of the CNG version of the desire is more than the Swift how is that even possible but yeah it is what it is because probably not many people are interested in a swift CNG but desire CNG is like Uber's favorite thank you so much for watching if you like this video make sure to give it a thumbs up that's like button and also subscribe to the channel don't forget to check out the aura not the Hundai
